                \<p><code> A Mars rover </code> is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars.
                     Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be
                      directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter
                       months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control.
                        They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more recent development is the Mars helicopter.</p>
