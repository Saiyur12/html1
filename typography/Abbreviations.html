   Game: Call Of Duty

   Call of Duty is a military first-person shooter video game series and media franchise published by Activision,
    starting in 2003. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several
     spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, was released on October 25, 2024.[1]

     The series originally focused on a World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing Call of Duty (2003) and Call of Duty 2 (2005) and
      Treyarch developing Call of Duty 3 (2006). Infinity Ward's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a modern setting and proved 
      to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare sub-series; a Modern Warfare remastered version released in 2016
      . Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made.

      As of October 2023, Call of Duty has sold over 500 million copies and has 100 million monthly active players across all platforms.[2][3]
       The franchise generated $30 billion in revenue by 2022.[4] The series is verified by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling first-person 
       shooter game series. It is also the most successful video game franchise created in the United States and the second best-selling video game franchise
              of all time. Other products in the franchise include a line of action figures designed by Plan B Toys, a card game created by Upper Deck Company,
              \ Mega Bloks sets by Mega Brands, and a comic book miniseries published by WildStorm Productions, and a feature film in development.
